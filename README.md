## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/lorenz-halt/diler_message_forwarder.git
   cd diler_msg-forwarder
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure environment variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your global credentials (for SMTP and DILER URL):
   ```
   DILER_URL=https://schule.de
   EMAIL_ADDRESS=email.sender@host.com
   EMAIL_PASSWORD=yyy
   SMTP_SERVER=mail.host.net
   SMTP_PORT=587
   ```

   Then create a `accounts.json` file to manage multiple DILER accounts and receiving email adresses:
   ```json
   [
     {
       "DILER_USERNAME": "user1",
       "DILER_PASSWORD": "pass1",
       "TO_EMAIL_ADDRESS": ["mail1@example.com", "mail2@example.com"]
     },
     {
       "DILER_USERNAME": "user2",
       "DILER_PASSWORD": "pass2",
       "TO_EMAIL_ADDRESS": ["mail3@example.com"]
     }
   ]
   ```

## Usage

To run the application, execute the following command:
```
cd diler_msg-forwarder
python src/main.py
```

This will log into the DILER Schule website, check for unread messages, forward them to the specified email address, and mark them as read, with each user respectively.

## Cronjob (Linux)

To run the application periodically on your device consider setting up cronjobs.

These two example cronjobs execute the script Mondays to Fridays during working hours every 30 minutes and Sundays afternoon once (for emergency messages):
```
crontab -e
```
Add to the end (replace __path to your clone__):
```
*/30 6-18 * * 1-5 __path to your clone__/diler-msg-forwarder/venv/bin/python __path to your clone__/diler-msg-forwarder/src/main.py >> /var/log/diler_msg.log 2>&1
0 16 * * 0 __path to your clone__/diler-msg-forwarder/venv/bin/python __path to your clone__/diler-msg-forwarder/src/main.py >> /var/log/diler_msg.log 2>&1
```
